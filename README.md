CGM CLASSIC WATCHFACE

The CGM Classic face has been optimized for the different pebble applications / SDK versions.
If you are running the CGM Classic face, please use the following watchfaces going forward:
* For those running the Orange Pebble App (SDK 2) - Use the Nightscout face.
* For those running the Grey Pebble App (SDK 3) - Use the CGM In The Cloud Face (CGMITC) - shown here. 
* These watchfaces can be used on all watches expect the Round. These watchfaces are not for Share users.

The new CGMITC face has been designed to use the features offered by SDK 3 to offer a more graphical, personal, and intuitive design.
It is also primarily designed to look like a "diabetes dashboard", with a digital font offered
and as if you are running a car but in this case - a pancreas.

In addition to showing blood sugars and all associated data, 
the new CGMITC face has the following features that can be set in the settings:
* Set vibrations on or off (set SLEEP FACE).
* Display raw however you want (all raw on or off, or just turn unfiltered raw on or off).
* Display two different kinds of fonts.
* Display battery levels as numbers or intuitive emojis - emojis will go from happy to sad to angry as the power levels drop.
* Express how you are feeling - You can type in a name at the bottom with emojis to express how you are feeling that day; note emojis will always sleep when vibrations are turned off.
* Set animations on or off.

For those on Pebble Time with Color:
* Color your Watchface - You can set different color patterns on the watchface to further personalize your experience.
* Highlights for Alerts - Alerts will be highlighted in red, so that they become more noticeable. For coders - can change to any color you like. Also option available for a separate "warning" color before an "urgent" color. Both are currently same color in this code.
* Text Color - Default text color can be set to black (for lighter color patterns) or white (for dark color patterns).
